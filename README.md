# CampusThrift: A clothing resell app for Cornell students

## Description
CampusThrift is an iOS application designed for Cornell University students, providing a convenient platform to both buy and resell clothing items. Users can list their own clothing by inputting a title, description, price, and image. While the item has still not been sold, any of these fields can be edited.

Users can also view listings that other students have made and either buy the item directly or add it to their shopping cart. Additionally, they can also like posts, follow users, and view posts only from those they follow.

Within the profile section of the app, users can view their like history, post history, and transaction history, and they can add funds to their balance.
